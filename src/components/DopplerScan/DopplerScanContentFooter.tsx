      <h3>What is a Doppler Scan?</h3>
      <p>
        A Doppler scan in Malleshwaram , Bangalore is a specialized ultrasound
        technique that measures the direction and speed of blood flow within the
        body. By using high-frequency sound waves, this scan can detect movement
        within the blood vessels, making it a crucial tool in diagnosing various
        vascular conditions. Unlike traditional ultrasounds that create images
        of the internal organs, Doppler scans focus on blood flow, helping
        physicians identify any blockages, clots, or abnormal patterns that
        might indicate a serious medical issue.
