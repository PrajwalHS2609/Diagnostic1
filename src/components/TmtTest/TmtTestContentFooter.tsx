      <h3>What is a TMT Test?</h3>
      <p>
        The TMT Test in Malleshwaram, Bangalore, or Treadmill Test, is a type of
        exercise stress test that monitors the heart’s performance during
        physical activity. While the body is at rest, it’s easier for the heart
        to pump blood; however, when you exercise, the heart needs to work
        harder to circulate blood throughout the body. The TMT Test in
        Malleshwaram, Bangalore involves walking or running on a treadmill while
        your heart rate, blood pressure, and electrical activity (through an
        ECG) are monitored. This allows cardiologists to observe how your heart
        responds to stress and detect potential blockages or other issues in the
        coronary arteries.

        Malleshwaram, Bangalore can reveal abnormalities that may not be apparent
        when the heart is at rest.

      <h3>How Does the TMT Test Work?</h3>
      <p>
        The TMT Test in Malleshwaram, Bangalore typically follows a simple and
        straightforward process. Here’s what you can expect during your visit to
        Global Health Diagnostics for your TMT test:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h6>1. Preparation:</h6>
          <p>
            Before the TMT Test in Malleshwaram, Bangalore begins, electrodes
            will be attached to your chest, arms, and legs. These electrodes are
            connected to an electrocardiogram (ECG) machine, which will monitor
            your heart's electrical activity during the test.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>2. Baseline Readings:</h6>
          <p>
            Your resting heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG readings will be
            recorded before starting the treadmill exercise.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>3. Exercise Phase:</h6>
          <p>
            You will start walking on the treadmill at a slow speed. As the test
            progresses, the speed and incline of the treadmill will gradually
            increase. The goal is to put your heart under stress by mimicking
            physical activity, such as brisk walking or running. Throughout the
            TMT Test in Malleshwaram, Bangalore, your heart rate, blood pressure,
            and ECG readings will be continuously monitored.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>4. Monitoring Symptoms:</h6>

            immediately if any concerning symptoms arise.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>5. Recovery:</h6>
          <p>
            After the exercise phase, you will continue to be monitored while
            your heart rate returns to normal. This recovery phase is important
            for evaluating how quickly your heart recovers after exertion.
          </p>
        </li>
