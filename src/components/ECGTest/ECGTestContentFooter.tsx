      <h3>What is an ECG Test?</h3>
      <p>
        The ECG Test in Malleshwaram, Bangalore is a non-invasive procedure that
        records the electrical signals in your heart. These signals trigger your
        heart to beat and are responsible for coordinating the movement of blood
        through your body. By examining the electrical impulses, doctors can
        assess whether the heart is beating too fast, too slow, or irregularly.
        The ECG Test in Malleshwaram, Bangalore can also detect other
        heart-related issues like heart attacks, blockages, and enlargement of
        the heart chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process of taking an ECG Test in Malleshwaram, Bangalore at Global
        Health Diagnostics is quick and painless, involving the placement of
        small electrodes on the skin of your chest, arms, and legs. These
        electrodes detect electrical activity, which is then displayed as waves
        on a monitor or printed for further analysis.
